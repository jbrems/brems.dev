# Pocemon

A Pocemon is a magical creature that looks a lot like a Pokemon but only shows up in POCs.

## Lives

A Pocemon starts with 3 lives or 100% of their HP and is mysteriously hidden.

Each time an incorrect guess is made, 1 live or 33% if its HP is deducted.

When a Pocemon loses all its HP, it faints and is shortly revealed.

## My favorite Pocemon

<Pocemon id="25" hidden={false} />
