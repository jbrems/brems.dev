# Popup vs modal vs overlay

The terms `popup`, `modal`, and `overlay` are often used interchangeably but refer to different UI elements with distinct behaviors and purposes.

Here's a quick overview of the differences between these terms.

## Overlay
An `overlay` is any element that is rendered over the main content of the UI and is usually a temporary addition to the view.

`Modals`, `popups`, and `tooltips` are all different kinds of `overlays`. 

## Modal
A `modal` is an `overlay` that blocks interaction with the main content of the UI until the `modal` is closed.

Important actions or information that should not be ignored can be shown in a `modal`. 

<Overlay>
  <Modal />
</Overlay>

## Popup
A `popup` is an `overlay` that does not block interactions with the main content. It usually disappears after a short time or when dismissed by the user.

`Toasts` and `snackbars` are examples of good `popups`. `Popups` are also often used for intrusive ads.
<Overlay>
  <Snackbar />
  <Toast />
</Overlay>

## Tooltip

A `tooltip` is a small `overlay` that appears when the user hovers over an element and usually disappears when the cursor moves away.

`Tooltips` typically contain short unstyled text.

<Overlay>
  <Tooltip />
</Overlay>

## Popover

A `popover` is similar to a `tooltip`, but it is generally larger and can contain more complex content, such as images, buttons, or forms.

`Popovers` are often triggered by clicking an element and generally have to be closed.

<Overlay>
  <Popover />
</Overlay>

## Drawer
A `drawer` is an `overlay` that enters the page from the left or right side of the screen.

`Drawers` are often used for navigation menus or for additional options like filtering and sorting.

<Overlay>
  <Drawer />
</Overlay>

## Top/bottom sheet
`Top sheets` and `bottom sheets` are `overlays` that enter the page from the top or bottom of the screen.

`Top and bottom sheets` are often used on mobile devices.

<PhoneOverlay>
  <Sheet />
</PhoneOverlay>
