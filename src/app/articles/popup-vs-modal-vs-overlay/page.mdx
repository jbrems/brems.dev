# Popup vs modal vs overlay

The terms `popup`, `modal`, and `overlay` are often used interchangeably, but they refer to different UI elements with distinct behaviors and purposes.

So if you want to impress your UI/UX designer friends or colleagues, here's a quick rundown of the differences between these terms.

## Overlay
An `overlay` is any element that is rendered over the main content of the UI and is generally a temporary addition to the page.

`Modals`, `popups`, and `tooltips` are all different kinds of `overlays`. 

## Modal
A `modal` is an overlay that blocks interactions with the main content until the `modal` is closed. Important actions or information that cannot be ignored can be shown in a `modal`. 

Examples of a `modal` are a login form or a delete confirmation alert.

<Overlay>
  <Modal />
</Overlay>

## Popup
A `popup` is an overlay that does not block interactions with the main content. It usually disappears after a short time or when dismissed.

`Toasts` and `snackbars` are examples of `popups`.

<Overlay>
  <Snackbar />
  <Toast />
</Overlay>

## Tooltip

A `tooltip` is a small overlay that appears when the user hovers over an element and usually disappears when the user moves the cursor away.

## Drawer
A `drawer` is an `overlay` that enters the page from the side of the screen (either from the left or from the right).

<Overlay>
  <Drawer />
</Overlay>

## Top/bottom sheet
A `top sheet` is an overlay that enters the page from the top. A `bottom sheet` is an overlay that enters the page from the bottom.

These `overlays` are often used on mobile devices.

<Overlay>
  <Sheet />
</Overlay>
