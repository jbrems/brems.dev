# Popup vs modal vs overlay

## Overlay
**Popovers**, **modals**, and **tooltips** are all kinds of **overlays** since they are rendered on top of (or overlay) the main content.  

**Popup** can also be used to describe any element that pops up on the screen but it does carry a negative conotation since the era of annoying popup ads.

Sometimes the term **overlay** is used to refer to the semi-transparent **backdrop** between a **modal** and the main content.

There are 2 main categories of **overlays**:
* **Modal overlays** - block user interaction with the main content
* **Non-modal overlays** - do not block interaction with the main content

## Modal vs non-modal overlays
Any **overlay** can be a **modal overlay** as long as it prevents the user from interacting with the main content until the overlay is dismissed.
In practice **dialogs** and **alerts** are almost always **modal overlays** while **toasts** and **snackbars** are mostly **non-modal overlays**. 

**Modal overlays** are often called **interruptive** while **non-modal overlays** can be described as **ambient**, **contextual**, or **informative**.

**Modal overlays** can use a **backdrop** and a **focus trap** to prevent the user from interacting with the main content.

<Overlay>
  <Modal />
</Overlay>

## Drawers & sheets
**Drawers** (side sheets) and **bottom sheets** are overlays that slide into the view from the edges of the screen.

* **Drawers** are often used on bigger screens where there is plenty of horizontal space.
* **Bottom sheets** are mostly used on mobile screens where they are easy to reach with your thumb.

**Drawers** and **bottom sheets** can either be modal or non-modal overlays depending on whether they block main content interaction or not.

In responsive design, non-modal **drawers** on desktop often collapse to modal bottom sheets on mobile.

<div className="flex flex-wrap gap-8">
  <Overlay>
    <Drawer />
  </Overlay>

  <PhoneOverlay>
    <Sheet />
  </PhoneOverlay>
</div>

## Toasts & snackbars
Toasts and snackbars are brief, non-modal overlays used to provide feedback about an operation.

They are designed to be "fire-and-forget" and usually disappear automatically after a few seconds.

<Overlay>
  <Snackbar />
  <Toast />
</Overlay>


## Tooltip

A **tooltip** is a small **overlay** that appears when the user hovers over an element and usually disappears when the cursor moves away.

**Tooltips** typically contain short unstyled text.

<Overlay>
  <Tooltip />
</Overlay>

## Popover

A **popover** is similar to a **tooltip**, but it is generally larger and can contain more complex content, such as images, buttons, or forms.

**Popovers** are often triggered by clicking an element and are dismissed by clicking or interacting outside of the popover.

<Overlay>
  <Popover />
</Overlay>
