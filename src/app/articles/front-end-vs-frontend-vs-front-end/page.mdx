# "Front-end" vs "frontend" vs "front end"

## Front end
The terms `front-end`, `frontend`, and `front end` are used interchangeably to refer to the part of a software application that the user interacts with.

If you want to use the correct term however, use `front end` as a noun and `front-end` as an adjective.

For example:
```text
The front end is maintained by front-end developers.
```

## Back end
The same applies to `back-end`, `backend`, and `back end`, which refer to the part of the application that the user does not interact with directly.

For example:
```text
The back end is maintained by back-end developers.
```
